/**
 * The share cards are generated artefacts that are committed to the repo, and
 * this is what stops them going stale.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR: someone edits an article title, ships it, and
 * the card still shows the old one. Nothing else would ever notice — the page
 * is correct, the tags are correct, the image exists and 200s. It is only
 * wrong in a PNG nobody reopens.
 *
 * So every card is re-rendered here from the current build and compared to the
 * committed file. Change a title, a design token, or the card layout without
 * running `pnpm og`, and this fails.
 *
 * It compares PIXELS, not encoded bytes — see `toPixels` in scripts/og-card.mjs
 * for why.
