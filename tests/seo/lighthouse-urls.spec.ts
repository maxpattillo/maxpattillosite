/**
 * The Lighthouse budget runs against a hand-written list of paths, and a hand-

 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR, which already happened: an article was
 * unpublished and renamed, `lighthouserc.json` kept pointing at the old URL,
 * and CI went red in the Lighthouse job -- a separate, slower job, three runs
 * per URL, minutes after the fast suite had already gone green. The error there
 * says a page could not be collected, which reads like a Lighthouse problem
 * rather than a stale config.
 *
 * This moves that failure forward: same breakage, caught in milliseconds, with
