/**
 * End-to-end smoke tests.
 *
 * Deliberately few. The SEO suite already asserts every structural property
 * from the build manifest in milliseconds; duplicating those checks in a
 * browser would only make CI slower. Playwright is here for the three things a
 * manifest cannot observe:
 *
 *   1. Cloudflare's edge behaviour -- trailing-slash redirects and real 404
 *      status codes, which come from wrangler.jsonc, not from the HTML.
 *   2. Whether the page actually works with JavaScript disabled.
 *   3. Whether a page fits a phone. The manifest has no viewport, and every
 *      other check runs at a desktop size. See tests/e2e/mobile.spec.ts.
 *
 * It therefore runs against `wrangler dev`, the real Workers runtime serving
 * ./dist, rather than `astro preview`. `astro preview` would answer a
 * different question than the one that matters in production.
