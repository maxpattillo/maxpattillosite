/**
 * The social share cards, generated.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. `public/og/default.png` shipped as the scaffold's
 * placeholder: a blue rule on a blue-tinted charcoal, name set in a default
 * grotesque. Every page on the site pointed at it, so the one image that gets
 * seen *before* anyone visits was the only surface still rendering the exact
 * aesthetic DESIGN.md is written against. It was on the before-launch list in
 * AGENTS.md; this is that item.
 *
 * WHAT IT WRITES
 *
 *   public/og/default.png            the fallback, for every non-article page
 *   public/og/writing/<slug>.png     one per published article
 *
 * IT NEEDS A BUILD FIRST, because the article cards are titled from each
 * page's real `<h1>` in `.seo/manifest.json` -- see og-articles.mjs for why.
 * `pnpm og` runs the build for you.
 *
 * After changing an article title the loop is: build, og, build. The second
 * build is what copies the regenerated PNG out of `public/` and into `dist/`.
 * `tests/seo/og-cards.spec.ts` fails if you skip any of it.
 *
 * GENERATED, NOT DRAWN. Committed output, and the build never runs this.
 * `sharp` is already a devDependency for Astro's image pipeline, so this adds
 * nothing to install.
 *
 * Layout and palette live in og-card.mjs. This file only decides what to draw
 * and where to put it.
