 * previewed as a SQUARE THUMBNAIL, and the platform gets that square by centre-
 * cropping this image to 630x630 -- taking x 285..915 and discarding a third of
 * the card from each side.
 *
 * The card used to set the name flush left at x=88, which is 197px outside that
 * window. So the one thing the card exists to say arrived as "YCE / CORA".
 * Nothing else was wrong with it: at full width it read perfectly, which is
 * exactly why it survived -- the failure is invisible unless you look at the
 * crop.
 *
 * So the rule is: ANYTHING THAT MUST BE READ GOES INSIDE THE SAFE ZONE.
 * Everything else -- the panel, the title bar, the band --
 * may run outside it, because those crop to a fragment of themselves rather
 * than to a fragment of a word. A sliced title bar still reads as a title bar.
 *
 * Only the display name is held to this. The kicker and the band line are set
 * inside it too where they fit, but at the size a square thumbnail is actually
 * displayed -- 100-150px wide in every one of those contexts -- type below the
