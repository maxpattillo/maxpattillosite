/**
 * Which article cards should exist, and what each one says.
 *
 * READ FROM THE BUILD MANIFEST, NOT FROM FRONTMATTER. Each card is titled from
 * that page's real `<h1>` in `.seo/manifest.json`. Parsing the Markdown here
 * would mean a second, worse implementation of Astro's frontmatter handling,
 * and the failure it invites is the quiet one: a card whose title no longer
 * matches the page it links to. Reading real build output is the same rule
 * AGENTS.md gives for numbers on a page.
 *
 * Its own module so that generate-og.mjs and tests/seo/og-cards.spec.ts agree
 * on the set by construction. A test that computed the expected cards
 * differently from the generator would pass while both were wrong.
